# Travel / Leisure

I built a React.js app to help travelers decide their next destinations. Users can
select whether they want to travel in Europe or Asia, in which season they want to travel, and an approximation of how much they want to spend. Then the app returns ideal destinations that are based on those parameters. Travelers can also quickly change their parameters to see other destinations.

I'm proud of this project because of its embrace of buttons as tools to create user-interfaces that invite people to stay on webpages longer for the different pay-offs. I used SASSy design patterns to make the CSS readable, and my project responds well to different screen sizes, so it looks great on a phone.
