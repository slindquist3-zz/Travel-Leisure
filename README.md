## Button Code Challenge!
Scott Lindquist's Button Code Challenge.

### About this app

I built a React.js app to help travelers decide their next destinations. Users can
select whether they want to travel in Europe or Asia, in which season they want to travel, and an approximation of how much they want to spend. Then the app returns ideal destinations that are based on those parameters. Travelers can also quickly change their parameters to see other destinations.

I'm proud of this project because of its embrace of buttons as a means to create user-interfaces that invite people to stay longer on a webpage for the different pay-offs. My project also responds well to different screen sizes, so it looks great on a phone. I used SASSy design patterns to make the CSS readable, and with React my JavaScript is tight and modular.

### What I'm good at

As a developer, I'm a strong communicator who identifies and organizes what I need to accomplish while collaborating with other people; I can quickly pick up new technologies and have an eye for design.  

### Areas I'd like to improve

I'd like to learn more advanced JavaScript such as new libraries as well as get more experience supporting larger teams of developers to complete projects for clients.

### My ideal intern project

Ideal intern projects for me would be contributing to the rest of the engineering
team's work, even if that meant I started out working on smaller features for a client, because I want to feel that my work has a measurable impact and that my mentors and I would be mutually invested in my growth.  

### Why I want to intern at Button

I want to intern at Button because I want to become a better mobile developer, and an internship at Button would be an opportunity to grow professionally in an environment with mentorship.
