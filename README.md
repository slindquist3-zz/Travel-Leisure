### About this app

I built a React.js app to help travelers decide their next destinations. Users can
select whether they want to travel in Europe or Asia, in which season they want to travel, and an approximation of how much they want to spend. Then the app returns ideal destinations that are based on those parameters. Travelers can also quickly change their parameters to see other destinations.
